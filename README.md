"# RoadSign_rsignNet" 

The objective of this project is to develop convolution neural net for road sign classification using real world images. Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valentynsichkar/traffic-signs-preprocessed?select=datasets_preparing.py

In addition to develop custom CNN, transfer learning using pre-trained neural net (VGG16) will also be implemented to serve as performance benchmark.
